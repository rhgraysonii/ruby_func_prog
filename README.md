# Functional Programming With Ruby
Recent I read through [Mary Rose Cook](http://www.maryrosecook.com/)'s wonderful [Introduction To Functional Programming](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/one/an-introduction-to-functional-programming). I have always had
quite the interest in functional style programming, and found her introduction to demystify many of the harder points
that I came across in my own foray into the field. 

Being A Rubyist, I thought it would be fun to use [Steve Klabnik](http://www.steveklabnik.com)'s wonderful Ruby FP
library, [Frappucino](https://github.com/steveklabnik/frappuccino). That said, let's get started!
